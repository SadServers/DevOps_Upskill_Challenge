# DevOps Upskill Challenge
DevOps Upskill Challenge: From "Hello World" to Kubernetes

## What

A curriculum or roadmap that covers basic DevOps/SRE concepts and technologies. Aimed at students, technical people from other fields wanting to learn or move into DevOps (sysadmins, software developers, IT professionals etc) and junior DevOps.  

As a positive extra outcome, people working through this roadmap will end up with a Git DevOps project repository that they can use in their resume.

Characteristics:
- Objective-based. Each challenge will have clear conditions of victory.
- Practical, hands-on for the most part (derived from above).
- Not a "step-by-step" guide of the "follow the text and copy-paste" type. Not for passive consumers but more like "learning the hard way".
- Starting with the "why" in each section.
- There will be often many different ways of accomplishing the objective.
- There will be a bias towards skills needed in jobs and job interviews.

The DevOps Upskill Challenge project can be abbreviated as "DOUC".

(Douc is also a cute monkey)

# How

- Pick one challenge and try to accomplish its objectives. You can use a different order (but there are dependencies) or skip the challenges you are already familiar with.
- If you get stuck or have comments, you can ask in the `#devops_upskill_challenge` channel of the [Hangops Slack](https://hangops.slack.com/) or in the Reddit [/r/DevOpsUpskill](https://www.reddit.com/r/DevOpsUpskill/) community.

## Challenges

### [1. Linux Server](1.%20Linux%20Server/README.md)

- 1.1 Objective: characterize a server: what’s its purpose, is it busy, does it have errors?
- 1.2 Objective: parsing logs and metrics (find/grep/cut/uniq etc )

### [2. HTTP](2.%20HTTP/README.md))
- 2.1 Objective: create code that responds to HTTP requests (eg browser http://localhost:8080) with "Hello World". Examples with: Code (Java, Python, Golang, Java) and Web servers (Nginx, Apache)
Concepts:
    - HTTP protocol, header/body, response codes, curl
    - Golden metrics concepts
    - APIs concepts, REST, json 
    - "Architecture" types of applications (request/response / batch / streaming)

### 3. Git & GitHub
- 3.1 Objective: create your own private Github repository and commit previous HTTP exercise. Create PR.
- 3.2 Objective: (GitHub Actions) run parser test. Run code test.

### 4. Cloud Instance
- 4.1 Objective: get an AWS account.
- 4.2 Objective: get an ec2 instance, put the code from HTTP objective and see “Hello World” in a public hostname (should survive a reboot: systemd, Docker).

### 5. Infrastructure as Code - Ansible
(depends on HTTP code and Cloud instance)
- 5.1 Objective: deploy code / linux packages (eg web server) to ec2 instance

### 6. Docker
(depends on HTTP code and Cloud instance)
- 6.1 Objective: put the HTTP code in a Docker image, build and push to Docker registry.
- 6.2 Objective: run with Docker Compose in the ec2 instance
- 6.3 Objective: push everthing using Ansible

### 7. Cloud
(depends on HTTP code and Cloud instance)
- 7.1 Objective: add DNS with Route 53
- 7.2 Objective: create an AMI of the web server, deploy two servers behind ELB
- 7.3 Objective: create an autoscale group. Add the name of the instance to the output "hello world $instance_id". Test with a stress tool (objective is to see more than one instance).

### 8. Continous Integration (CI)
(depends on HTTP code and Cloud instance)
- 8.1 Objective: using Github actions, on push/merge changing the message (eg to “Hello Universe”), it gets deployed to cloud server(s) automatically

### 9. Infrastructure as Code - Terraform
(depends on AWS account)
- 9.1 Objective: create ec2 instance and requirements (VPC, subnet, sec group)
- 9.2 Objective: create all elements in the Cloud section

### 10. Observability & Alerting
(depends on HTTP code and Cloud instance)
- 10.1 Objective: add Prometheus/Grafana to count number of web requests
- 10.2 Objective: push web (application) logs to Loki or ElasticSearch
- 10.3 Objective: add Prom alerts on number/frequency of HTTP requests

### 11. Kubernetes
(Depends on Docker)
- 11.1 Objective: create a K8Scluster in the cloud (EKS for ex)
- 11.2 Objective: push web app Docker image to cloud repo (ECR for ex)
- 11.3 Objective: create Deployment manifest to create web app pod in k8s
- 11.4 Objective: add Prometheus/Grafana
- 11.5 Objective: add app log collection
- 11.6 Objective: automate (CI/CD) creation and deployment of new Docker images to K8S cluster upon code change & push.
